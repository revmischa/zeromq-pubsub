# ZeroMQ-PubSub - Publish/Subscribe event passing system based on ZeroMQ

ZeroMQ::PubSub providers a client/server framework for simple message
passing using ZeroMQ.

ZeroMQ::PubSub::Client is used to connect to a ZeroMQ::PubSub::Server
and can publish and subscribe to events.

This setup should work well as a low-latency, lightweight
mostly-reliable realtime message passing system. You can use in-proc,
TCP, IPC and multicast transports. See the ZeroMQ documentation for
more details.
